# Code School: Shaping Up With Angular.js Example App Using ControllerAs Syntax
---
As someone who absolutely loves codeschool, I wanted to bring one of the Angular examples they have up to date using the ControllerAs syntax. 

For this example, I am porting over the code from: 
<https://github.com/codeschool/ShapingUpWithAngular.js>

And refactoring everything to use the controllerAs syntax as it is the current best practice for building scalable single page applications with Angular 1x.

For more information about the controllerAs syntax format:
